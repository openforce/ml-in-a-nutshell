# Machine Learning in a Nutshell: Spam classification

This folder contains Zeppelin notebooks and data files related to [issue no. 3](http://www.openforce.com/2016/10/machine-learning-in-a-nutshell-issue-no-3-spam-classification-a-naive-approach/) and 4 of our blog article series [Machine Learning in a Nutshell](http://www.openforce.com/category/machine-learning/).

To get started please download and install [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) and [Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/download.html). Please note that the notebooks stored here have been tested with Apache Zeppelin 0.6.2 and Apache Spark 2.0.0.

Once you've done that you can easily import a notebook (e.g. `issue-3-baseline-model.json`) following the procedure described [here](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/latest/quickstart/explorezeppelinui.html).

Have fun!
